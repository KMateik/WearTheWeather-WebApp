Wear the Weather is a packing planner designed to help prepare you for your day, or your trip.

Using the "Today" tab, just enter your location and the application will give the weather conditions for the day as well as a clothing recommendation.

The "This Week" tab helps you dress for the weather during your trip. Given the location, Wear the Weather will provide you with the weather conditions, in the specified area/location, over the course of the next 7 days along with clothing recommendations for each day.
