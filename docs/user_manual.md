Wear the Weather is a packing planner to help prepare you for your day, or your trip. All it takes to use the weather is to enter your 
location in when prompted, and choose your trip length. If you are only going to the location for the day, use the current day tab. 
There is a trip planner tab to help you plan the clothes you need to bring on your trip. To use the trip planner, you must enter your
destination along with the start of your trip, and the end. From this information WearTheWeather will provide you with information on the 
weather over the course of the trip, along with clothing we reccomend to bring.
